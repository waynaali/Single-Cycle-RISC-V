🧩 Module Overview

The processor is implemented in a modular and hierarchical manner. Each SystemVerilog file corresponds to a well-defined functional block in the single-cycle RISC-V datapath, improving readability, testability, and future extensibility.

🔹 Core Datapath Modules

riscv_single.sv
Top-level module that instantiates and interconnects all datapath and control components.

pc.sv
Program Counter register that holds the current instruction address and updates every clock cycle.

adder.sv
Used for PC increment (PC + 4) and branch target address calculation.

instr_mem.sv
Instruction memory module that fetches instructions using the PC address.

register_file.sv
Implements 32 general-purpose registers (x0–x31) with two read ports and one write port.

data_mem.sv
Data memory module used by load (lw) and store (sw) instructions.

🔹 Control Path Modules

control_unit.sv
Generates high-level control signals based on the instruction opcode.

main_decoder.sv
Decodes instruction opcodes and determines overall datapath behavior.

Alu_decoder.sv
Decodes funct3 and funct7 fields to select the appropriate ALU operation.

🔹 Execution & Utility Modules

ALU.sv
Performs arithmetic and logical operations such as add, sub, and, or, xor, slt.

ALUResult.sv
Holds and forwards the ALU output to later stages of the datapath.

ExtendUnit.sv
Generates sign-extended immediates for I, S, B, and J instruction formats.

mux2to1.sv
2-to-1 multiplexer used throughout the datapath for control-based signal selection.

result_mux.sv (mux_3to1)
Selects the final write-back data (ALU result, memory output, or PC + 4).

🔹 Verification Files

testbench.sv
SystemVerilog testbench used to verify functional correctness of the processor.

tb_riscv_single_behav.wcfg
Waveform configuration file for simulation visualization.

inst.mem
Memory initialization file containing test instructions.
