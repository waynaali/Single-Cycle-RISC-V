# Single-Cycle-RISC-V
This repository presents the RTL design and verification of a 32-bit single-cycle RISC-V processor implemented in SystemVerilog. The processor follows the RV32I instruction set and executes each instruction in one clock cycle, integrating core components, program counter, instruction memory, register file, ALU, control unit, and data memory.
